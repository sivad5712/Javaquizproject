# 🧠 Java Quiz Project

This repository contains a complete beginner-friendly Java application along with a website presentation — a **Java Console Quiz App** and a **static HTML Website** explaining and linking to it.

The goal of this project is to **demonstrate a full development pipeline**: writing backend logic in Java, organizing source code, version control with Git, building a frontend using HTML/CSS, and publishing a live webpage with GitHub Pages.

> ✅ Perfect for students, beginners, and portfolios!
